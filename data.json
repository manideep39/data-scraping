This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of undefined, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the name variable, so it still holds the value of undefined. Variables with the let keyword (and const) are hoisted, but unlike var, don't get initialized. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError."},{"statement":["2\\.

Since the variable i in the first loop was declared using the var keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of i by 1 each time, using the unary operator ++. By the time the setTimeout callback function was invoked, i was equal to 3 in the first example. In the second loop, the variable i was declared using the let keyword: variables declared with the let (and const) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between { }). During each iteration, i will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop."},{"statement":["3\\.

With arrow functions, the this keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call perimeter, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example). There is no value radius on that object, which returns NaN."},{"statement":["4\\. What's the output?\n======================","    +true;\n    !'Lydia';"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: A The unary plus tries to convert an operand to a number. true is 1, and false is 0. The string 'Lydia' is a truthy value. What we're actually asking, is \"is this truthy value falsy?\". This returns false."},{"statement":["5\\.

Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket \\[ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket \\]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. mouse\\[bird.size\\]: First it evaluates bird.size, which is \"small\". mouse\\[\"small\"\\] returns true However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. mouse does not have a key called bird, which means that mouse.bird is undefined. Then, we ask for the size using dot notation: mouse.bird.size. Since mouse.bird is undefined, we're actually asking undefined.size. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to Cannot read property \"size\" of undefined."},{"statement":["6\\.

First, variable c holds a value to an object. Later, we assign d with the same reference that c has to the object. When you change one object, you change all of them."},{"statement":["7\\.

Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object. When we use the == operator, it only checks whether it has the same value. They both have the value of 3, so it returns true. However, when we use the === operator, both value and type should be the same. It's not: new Number() is not a number, it's an object. Both return false."},{"statement":["8\\.

Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children. Since freddie is a child, the function is not passed down, and not available on the freddie instance: a TypeError is thrown."},{"statement":["9\\. What's the output?\n======================","    let greeting;\n    greetign = {}; // Typo!\n    console.log(greetign);"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: A It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped greeting as greetign, the JS interpreter actually saw this as global.greetign = {} (or window.greetign = {} in a browser). In order to avoid this, we can use \"use strict\". This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything."},{"statement":["10\\.

(Everything besides primitive types are objects) A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable."},{"statement":["11\\.

For that reason, we can call Person.getFullName(), but member.getFullName throws a TypeError. If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property: Person.prototype.getFullName = function() { return \\`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}\\`; };"},{"statement":["12\\. What's the output?\n=======================","    Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {\n      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n    };"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: A For sarah, we didn't use the new keyword. When using new, this refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add new, this refers to the global object! We said that this.firstName equals \"Sarah\" and this.lastName equals \"Smith\". What we actually did, is defining global.firstName = 'Sarah' and global.lastName = 'Smith'. sarah itself is left undefined, since we don't return a value from the Person function."},{"statement":["13\\.

It then reaches the target element, and bubbling begins."},{"statement":["14\\. All object have prototypes.\n================================","    function sum(a, b) {\n      return a + b;\n    }\n    \n    sum(1, '2');"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: B All objects have prototypes, except for the base object. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the new keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as .toString. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you."},{"statement":["15\\. What's the output?\n=======================","    let number = 0;\n    console.log(number++);\n    console.log(++number);\n    console.log(number);"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: C JavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called implicit type coercion. Coercion is converting from one type into another. In this example, JavaScript converts the number 1 into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (1) and a string type ('2'), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like \"Hello\" + \"World\", so what's happening here is \"1\" + \"2\" which returns \"12\"."},{"statement":["16\\.

What's the output?\n=======================","    function getAge(...args) {\n      console.log(typeof args);\n    }\n    \n    getAge(21);"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: C When testing equality, primitives are compared by their value, while objects are compared by their reference. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory. The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality. This is why both { age: 18 } === { age: 18 } and { age: 18 } == { age: 18 } return false."},{"statement":["19\\.

An array is an object, so typeof args returns \"object\""},{"statement":["20\\. What's the output?\n=======================","    const sum = eval('10*10+5');"],"explanation":"Answer Answer: C With \"use strict\", you can make sure that you don't accidentally declare global variables.

This is because in browsers, we don't just have the runtime engine, we also have something called a WebAPI. The WebAPI gives us the setTimeout function to start with, and for example the DOM. After the callback is pushed to the WebAPI, the setTimeout function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack. Now, foo gets invoked, and \"First\" is being logged. foo is popped off the stack, and baz gets invoked. \"Third\" gets logged. The WebAPI can't just add stuff to the stack whenever it's ready. Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the queue. This is where an event loop starts to work. An event loop looks at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack. bar gets invoked, \"Second\" gets logged, and it's popped off the stack."},{"statement":["31\\.

Primitive types are boolean, null, undefined, bigint, number, string, and symbol. What differentiates a primitive from an object is that primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note that 'foo'.toUpperCase() evaluates to 'FOO' and does not result in a TypeError. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. String, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates.

However, a generator function can be \"stopped\" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a yield keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t return the value, it yields the value. First, we initialize the generator function with i equal to 10. We invoke the generator function using the next() method. The first time we invoke the generator function, i is equal to 10. It encounters the first yield keyword: it yields the value of i. The generator is now \"paused\", and 10 gets logged. Then, we invoke the function again with the next() method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with i equal to 10. Now, it encounters the next yield keyword, and yields i \\* 2. i is equal to 10, so it returns 10 \\* 2, which is 20. This results in 10, 20."},{"statement":["45\\.

When you assign a reference from one variable to another, you make a copy of that reference. (note that they don't have the same reference!) Then, we set the variable person equal to null. We are only modifying the value of the person variable, and not the first element in the array, since that element has a different (copied) reference to the object.

This only happens if all operators have the same precedence. We only have one type of operator: +. For addition, the associativity is left-to-right. 3 + 4 gets evaluated first. This results in the number 7. 7 + '5' results in \"75\" because of coercion. JavaScript converts the number 7 into a string, see question 15. We can concatenate two strings using the +operator. \"7\" + \"5\" results in \"75\"."},{"statement":["49\\.

Based on the radix (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the parseInt checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters. \\* is not a valid number.

In this case, the elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement typeof num === \"number\" returns true. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function. However, we don’t return a value.

When we pass arguments by value, a copy of that value is created (see question 46). The variable birthYear has a reference to the value \"1997\". The argument year also has a reference to the value \"1997\", but it's not the same value as birthYear has a reference to. When we update the value of year by setting year equal to \"1998\", we are only updating the value of year. birthYear is still equal to \"1997\". The value of person is an object. The argument member has a (copied) reference to the same object. When we modify a property of the object member has a reference to, the value of person will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. person's name property is now equal to the value \"Lydia\""},{"statement":["52\\.

In a browser, window.y is now equal to 10. Then, we declare a variable x with the value of y, which is 10. Variables declared with the let keyword are block scoped, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) in this case. When we use the typeof operator, the operand x is not defined: we are trying to access x outside of the block it's declared in. This means that x is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type \"undefined\". console.log(typeof x) returns \"undefined\". However, we created a global variable y when setting y equal to 10.

However, variables declared with the var, const or let keyword cannot be deleted using the delete operator. The name variable was declared with a const keyword, so its deletion is not successful: false is returned. When we set age equal to 21, we actually added a property called age to the global object.

In this case, only the properties with the names \"level\" and \"health\" are included, \"username\" is excluded. data is now equal to \"{\"level\":19, \"health\":90}\". If the replacer is a function, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying.

The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is \"undefined\". In this case, we spread the properties of the value object into a new object, so x has the default value of { number: 10 }. The default argument is evaluated at call time! Every time we call the function, a new object is created. We invoke the multiply function the first two times without passing a value: x has the default value of { number: 10 }. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is 20. The third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called value. The \\*= operator is actually shorthand for x.number = x.number \\* 2: we modify the value of x.number, and log the multiplied value 20.

The second argument is the current value, y. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value. In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value. The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional initialValue argument to the reduce method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call. On the first call, the accumulator (x) is 1, and the current value (y) is 2. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator and current value: 1 and 2 get logged. If you don't return a value from a function, it returns undefined. On the next call, the accumulator is undefined, and the current value is 3. undefined and 3 get logged.

However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after return. You could see this as: return; a + b; This means that a + b is never reached, since a function stops running after the return keyword.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also \"hide\" properties on objects this way (although not entirely.

Although we can get a promise's value with both .then and await, they work a bit differently. In the firstFunction, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is console.log('second') in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string I have resolved, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty. With the await keyword in secondFunction, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

Whenever the JavaScript engine sees that one or more values are not a number, it coerces the number into a string. The first one is 1, which is a numerical value. 1 + 2 returns the number 3. However, the second one is a string \"Lydia\". \"Lydia\" is a string and 2 is a number: 2 gets coerced into a string. \"Lydia\" and \"2\" get concatenated, which results in the string \"Lydia2\". { name: \"Lydia\" } is an object. Neither a number nor an object is a string, so it stringifies both.

In this example, we use dot notation (colorConfig.colors) instead of bracket notation (colorConfig\\[\"colors\"\\]). With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called colors on the colorConfig object. There is no property called colors, so this returns undefined. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using \\[1\\]. We cannot do this on a value that's undefined, so it throws a TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of undefined. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket \\[ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket \\]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

Variables with the let keyword (and const) are hoisted, but unlike var, don't get initialized. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the \"temporal dead zone\". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError.

As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. Since this is an interval, setting config to null or delete-ing config.alert won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called.

Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that counterOne points to.

On the first line of funcOne, we call the myPromise promise, which is an asynchronous operation. While the engine is busy completing the promise, it keeps on running the function funcOne. The next line is the asynchronous setTimeout function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop here.) Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the setTimeout callback. This means that Last line! gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. This is the last line of funcOne, the promise resolved, and Promise! gets logged. However, since we're invoking funcTwo(), the call stack isn't empty, and the callback of the setTimeout function cannot get added to the callstack yet. In funcTwo we're, first awaiting the myPromise promise. With the await keyword, we pause the execution of the function until the promise has resolved (or rejected). Then, we log the awaited value of res (since the promise itself returns a promise). This logs Promise!. The next line is the asynchronous setTimeout function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. We get to the last line of funcTwo, which logs Last line! to the console. Now, since funcTwo popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (() => console.log(\"Timeout!\") from funcOne, and () => console.log(\"Timeout!\") from funcTwo) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs Timeout!, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs Timeout!, and gets popped off the stack. This logs Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout!

The returned value of the updateUser function is the user object, which means that the value of updatedUser is a reference to the same user object that user points to. updatedUser === user equals true."},{"statement":["149\\.

The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji. Then, we invoke the splice method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of \\['🍊', '🍎'\\]. At last, we invoke the unshift method on the fruit array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‘🍇’ in this case, as the first element in the array. The fruit array now consists of \\['🍇', '🍊', '🍎'\\]."},{"statement":["150\\.

Since the value of dog is an object, animals\\[dog\\] actually means that we’re creating a new property called \"object Object\" equal to the new object. animals\\[\"object Object\"\\] is now equal to { emoji: \"🐶\", name: \"Mara\"}. cat is also an object, which means that animals\\[cat\\] actually means that we’re overwriting the value of animals\\[\\`\\`\"\\`\\`object Object\\`\\`\"\\`\\`\\] with the new cat properties. Logging animals\\[dog\\], or actually animals\\[\"object Object\"\\] since converting the dog object to a string results \"object Object\", returns the { emoji: \"🐈\", name: \"Sara\" }."},{"statement":["151\\.

This means that the this keyword is not referring to the user object, but refers to the global scope in this case. The value of email within the user object does not get updated.

If one promise fails, the Promise.all method rejects with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, promise3 rejected with the value \"Third\". We’re catching the rejected value in the chained catch method on the runPromises invocation to catch any errors within the runPromises function. Only \"Third\" gets logged, since promise3 rejected with this value."},{"statement":["153\\.

The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the keys array, which returns an array which first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index. This creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in { name: \"Lydia\", age: 22 }"},{"statement":["154\\.

When we set the variable member equal to the object returned by the createMember function, we didn't pass a value for address, which means that the value of address is the default empty object {}. An empty object is a truthy value, which means that the condition of the address ? address : null conditional returns true. The value of address is the empty object {}."},{"statement":["155\\.

The ! operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be false, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be true. In this case, the returned value of typeof randomValue is the truthy value \"number\", meaning that the value of !typeof randomValue is the boolean value false. !typeof randomValue === \"string\" always returns false, since we're actually checking false === \"string\". Since the condition returned false, the code block of the else statement gets run, and Yay it's a string! gets logged."}]}
