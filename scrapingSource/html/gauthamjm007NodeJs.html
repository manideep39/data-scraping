<h3>What is NodeJS?</h3>
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, <strong>JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser</strong>. Node JS was created by <a href="https://github.com/ry">Ryan Dahl</a>, Ryan Dahl is a software engineer and the original developer of the Node.js JavaScript runtime.</p>

<h3>How can you avoid callback hells?</h3>
<p>There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells: <br /> 1.modularization: break callbacks into independent functions, <br /> 2.use a control flow library, like async. <br /> 3.use generators with Promises, <br /> 4.use async/await (note that it is only available in the latest v7 release and not in the LTS version</p>

<h3>Name the types of API functions in Node?</h3>
<p>There are two types of functions in Node.js. <br/>
1.Blocking functions - In a blocking operation, all other code is blocked from executing until an I/O event that is being waited on occurs. Blocking functions execute synchronously. <br/>2.Non-blocking functions - In a non-blocking operation, multiple I/O calls can be performed without the execution of the program being halted. Non-blocking functions execute asynchronously.</p>

<h3>What are streams in Nodejs Explain the different types of streams present in Nodejs?</h3>
<p>Streams are objects that allow the reading of data from the source and writing of data to the destination as a continuous process.<br/>
There are four types of streams.<br/>
<Readable> to facilitate the reading operation.<br/>
<Writable> to facilitate the writing operation.<br/>
<Duplex> to facilitate both read and write operations.<br/>
<Transform> is a form of Duplex stream that performs computations based on the available input.<br/></p>

In other words, in an application’s request-response cycle these functions have access to various request &amp; response objects along with the next function of the cycle,The next function of middleware is represented with the help of a variable, usually named next. Most commonly performed tasks by the middleware functions are <br/></p>
<p>Execute any type of code<br/>
Update or modify the request and the response objects<br/>
Finish the request-response cycle<br/>
Invoke the next middleware in the stack</p>

<h3>Differentiate between spawn and fork methods in Nodejs?</h3>
<p>In Node.js, the spawn() is used to launch a new process with the provided set of commands. This method doesn’t create a new V8 instance and just one copy of the node module is active on the processor. When your child process returns a large amount of data to the Node you can invoke this method.</p>

<h3>Explain the purpose of ExpressJS package?</h3>
<p>Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that facilitates the management of the flow of data between server and routes in the server-side applications. It is a lightweight and flexible framework that provides a wide range of features required for the web as well as mobile application development. Express.js is developed on the middleware module of Node.js called connect. The connect module further makes use of http module to communicate with Node.js. Thus, if you are working with any of the connect based middleware modules, then you can easily integrate with Express.js.</p>

<h3>Explain the usage of a buffer class in Nodejs?</h3>
<p>Buffer class in Node.js is used for storing the raw data in a similar manner of an array of integers. But it corresponds to a raw memory allocation that is located outside the V8 heap. It is a global class that is easily accessible can be accessed in an application without importing a buffer module. Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data. So, when dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it’s necessary to handle octet streams.</p>

<h3>How does Nodejs handle the child threads?</h3>
<p>In general, Node.js is a single threaded process and doesn’t expose the child threads or thread management methods. But you can still make use of the child threads using spawn() for some specific asynchronous I/O tasks which execute in the background and don’t usually execute any JS code or hinder with the main event loop in the application. If you still want to use the threading concept in your application you have to include a module called ChildProcess explicitly.</p>

<h3>Explain stream in Nodejs along with its various types?</h3>
<p>Streams in Node.js are the collection of data similar to arrays and strings. They are objects using which you can read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner. It might not be available at once and need not to have fit in the memory. These streams are especially useful for reading and processing a large set of data. In Node.js, there are four fundamental types of streams:<br/>
Readable: Used for reading large chunks of data from the source.<br/>
Writeable: Use for writing large chunks of data to the destination.<br/>
Duplex: Used for both the functions; read and write.<br/>
Transform: It is a duplex stream that is used for modifying the data.</p>

<h3>What Are The Key Features Of NodeJs?</h3>
<pre><code>**Asynchronous event driven IO** helps concurrent request handling – All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.&lt;br/&gt;
**Fast in Code execution** – Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster.&lt;br/&gt;
**Single Threaded but Highly Scalable** – Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.&lt;br/&gt;
**Node.js library uses JavaScript** – This is another important aspect of Node.js from the developer’s point of view. The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.&lt;br/&gt;
**There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node.js** framework – The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.&lt;br/&gt;
**No Buffering** – Node.js applications never buffer any data. They simply output the data in chunks.&lt;br/&gt;

REPL provides an environment similar to that of Unix/Linux shell or a window console, in which we can enter the command and the system, in turn, responds with the output. REPL performs the following tasks.<br/></p>
<p><strong>READ</strong> - It Reads the input from the user, parses it into JavaScript data structure and then stores it in the memory.<br/>
<strong>EVAL</strong> - It Executes the data structure.<br/>
<strong>PRINT</strong> - It Prints the result obtained after evaluating the command.<br/>

<h3>What Is The Difference Between Nodejs AJAX And JQuery?</h3>
<p>The one common trait between Node.js, AJAX, and jQuery is that all of them are the advanced implementation of JavaScript. However, they serve completely different purposes.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Node.Js</strong> :<br/></p>
<p>It is a server-side platform for developing client-server applications. For example, if we’ve to build an online employee management system, then we won’t do it using client-side JS. But the Node.js can certainly do it as it runs on a server similar to Apache, Django not in a browser.<br/></p>
<p><strong>AJAX</strong> (Aka Asynchronous Javascript And XML) :<br/></p>
<p>It is a client-side scripting technique, primarily designed for rendering the contents of a page without refreshing it. There are a no. of large companies utilizing AJAX such as Facebook and Stack Overflow to display dynamic content.<br/></p>
<p><strong>JQuery</strong> :<br/></p>
<p>It is a famous JavaScript module which complements AJAX, DOM traversal, looping and so on. This library provides many useful functions to help in JavaScript development. However, it’s not mandatory to use it but as it also manages cross-browser compatibility, so can help you produce highly maintainable web applications.<br/></p>

<h3>What Is EventEmitter In NodeJs?</h3>
<pre><code>Events module in Node.js allows us to create and handle custom events. The Event module contains “EventEmitter” class which can be used to raise and handle custom events. It is accessible via the following code.&lt;br/&gt;
```
// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
```
&lt;br/&gt;
When an EventEmitter instance encounters an error, it emits an “error” event. When a new listener gets added, it fires a “newListener” event and when a listener gets removed, it fires a “removeListener” event.

EventEmitter provides multiple properties like “on” and “emit”. The “on” property is used to bind a function to the event and “emit” is used to fire an event.

<p>Node.js provides a &lt;child_process&gt; module which supports following three methods to create a child process.<br/></p>
<pre><code>**exec** – &lt;child_process.exec&gt; method runs a command in a shell/console and buffers the output.
**spawn** – &lt;child_process.spawn&gt; launches a new process with a given command.
**fork** – &lt;child_process.fork&gt; is a special case of the spawn() method to create child processes.
