    explanation: "It'd be tempting to look at a feature named \"typed array\" and assume it means an array of a specific type of values, like an array of only strings. However, typed arrays are really more about providing structured access to binary data using array-like semantics (indexed access, etc.). The \"type\" in the name refers to a \"view\" layered on type of the bucket of bits, which is essentially a mapping of whether the bits should be viewed as an array of 8-bit signed integers, 16-bit signed integers, and so on."
